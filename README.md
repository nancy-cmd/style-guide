## Overview

### The challenge

-In this project, you’ll be building your own basic design system for a website. In essence, you’ll be building a website to help you build MORE websites in the future! On your site, you’ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.

### What I learned

I tried to be a bit more creative with the desing of this  project; tried making it more like a scrapbook. i am still trying to learn how to best make use of media queries to make a website more responsive.

These are some code snippets i liked:

```html
<div style="overflow-x: auto;">
            <table class="table table-responsive">
                <tr>
                    <th>Roboto</th>
                    <th>Sofia Sans</th>
                    <th>Space Mono</th>
                    <th>Playfair Display</th>
                </tr>
```
```css
 @media screen and (min-width: 767px) and (max-width: 1023px){
    .proud-of-this-css {
    
    }
    }
```



### Continued development

I really want to continue adding to the design scrapbook and maybe add navigation and splitting up the site so that each section has its own page.
